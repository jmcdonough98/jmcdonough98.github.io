<h2>About Me </h2>
<p> I am a second year graduate student at the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/math">University of Minnesota</a>, interested in algebraic combinatorics and commutative algebra. I am currently reading with Pasha Pylyavskyy on the topic of Soergel bimodules and Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. I graduated from <a href="https://math.sdsu.edu">San Diego State University</a> in 2021, where I worked with Christopher O'Neill on problems relating to numerical semigroups and polytopes.</p>
